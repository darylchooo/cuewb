                    The Columbia University Chapter of Engineers Without Borders USA aims to address the problems facing people both locally and overseas, 
                    by leveraging the skills, talents, and passions of Columbia University students and the sponsorships formed with our organization.  
                    Our members come from many different arts, sciences, and engineering backgrounds, 
                    but share the desire to do meaningful work and make a difference.

                    The chapter currently consists of three programs in Ghana, Morocco, and Uganda.  
                    The <a href="ghana.html" target="_blank">Ghana program</a>, which started in 2004, 
                    used to work in the semi-urban town of Sakyikrom but now focuses on water management in the farming community of Obodan.   
                    The <a href="morocco.html" target="_blank">Morocco program</a>, which began in 2011, 
                    finished building a bridge in the rural community of Ait Bayoud in June 2013, 
                    and is now planning a future water project in the nearby community of Izgouaren.  
                    In 2008, the Uganda program was established to install <a href="#mfp">Multi-Function Platform engines</a> in the Soroti region, 
                    and has also implemented a now-complete <a href="#water">rainwater harvesting system</a>.  
                    Each project draws from the skills of its members to provide technical solutions to worldwide problems.

                    Currently, the Uganda team is focused on implementing a solar micro-grid in the rural community of Otubet.  
                    Before this project, the community had no access to an electrical grid in private or public spaces. 
                    Our goal has been to electrify schools, health centers, and businesses in Otubet. 
                    Through renewable solar energy, these entities will be able to provide higher quality services - including healthcare, education, and more - at lower costs, 
                    while also expanding the services that are provided. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, CU-EWB Uganda has implemented systems at two primary schools, the community medical center, and 33 businesses in the town center. 
                    These systems, installed in 2018 and 2019, power lighting at the businesses and lighting and power sockets at the primary schools and medical center. 
                    The primary schools and the medical center were also provided laptops, with the medical center receiving an electric microscope. 
                    During the first implementation trip in 2018, the benefactors of the project elected a governing board to oversee the system.

                <p>
                    The Rural Electrification Project is now in the monitoring and evaluation phase. 
                    We are currently collecting data to gain insight into the technical faults of the system and monitor the level of community support for the project. 
                    This data will guide us in completing the final phase of our project, 
                    where we will work with the Otubet community and our other in-country partners to make necessary repairs and ensure that the system is a reliable and sustainable source of electricity before closing out.

                forcing students (usually female) to <span>walk 5 to 6 km</span> to retrieve water from wells.

                <p>
                    In the summers of 2009 and 2010, 
                    a team from our program conducted a specific assessment trips to analyze the problem and take measurements of source reliability, water pricing, water quality, among other important factors to consider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In early 2011, the design for the entire rainwater-harvesting system, 
                    including the tank sizing, gutters, first-flush, and water treatment was completed and in June 2011, 
                    the team successfully implemented the three rainwater-harvesting systems. 
                    Quantitative and qualitative ssessments over the winter trip showed that the system had been successful in significantly reducing the city water consumption of the school and had even been able to supply water by itself for a whole week when a drought cut out the city water supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last step for the project was to ensure the quality and potability of the water. 
                    Testing was done over the course of the winter trip 2011 to verify this and found that the water provided by the system was significantly cleaner and more portable than the city water of the local town of Soroti. 
                    Ever since, the program has continued to monitor the quality of the water and the reliability of the rainwater harvesting system.
